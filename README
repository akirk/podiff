* Introduction

This file contains brief information about configuring, testing
and running PODIFF. It is *not* intended as a replacement
for the documentation, which is provided in the podiff.1 file.

* Overview

PO files contain considerable amount of additional information in form
of automatic comments.  This information is updated automatically by
gettext tools, which often makes it difficult to track modifications
to the translation itself.  For example, modifying one of the source
files can cause a change in locations of all translatable strings in
it, which will be reflected in automatic comments in the corresponding
PO file and will thus create considerable amount of diff output, even
if no messages in the file have changed.  This makes it difficult to
track changes to PO files.

PODIFF addresses this problem.  It finds differences in translatable
strings and translations between two PO files or between two revisions
of the same file.  Any changes in automatic and user comments and in
spacing or ordering of the file entries are ignored.

* Installation

To compile, type `make' in the top source directory.  No configuration
script is provided, the utility should compile on any POSIX system.

To install, type `make install'.  The utility is installed in
/usr/bin.  The following Make variables change that behavior:

** PREFIX

Installation prefix.  The default is "/usr".

** BINDIR

Directory to install the binary to.  Default is "$(PREFIX)/bin".

** MANDIR

Directory to install manual pages to.  Default is "$(PREFIX)/share/man".

** DESTDIR

Sets specific destination directory.  For example, `make
DESTDIR=/tmp/dist'  will prepend `/tmp/dist' before all installation names.

* Usage

See podiff(1), section "EXAMPLE".
